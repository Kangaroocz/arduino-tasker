Tasker for Arduino
==================

This is a cooperative scheduler for running multiple tasks on Arduino "at once".

*Cooperative* means that the tasks you create need to behave well -
to co-operate together by running for a short time only, otherwise it will not work.
*Scheduler* means that when creating a task you schedule when it is to be
started (in what time since now) and how many times it should be run
(once, X times or forever).

The "co-operation" is best achieved by creating small, short running tasks.
Basically wherever you'd like include a <code>delay()</code> in your Arduino program
that's the place where you actually want to break the code flow, split
the source code into separate functions and let them run as separate tasks.

There are many similar libraries for the same purpose but they are either
buggy (don't handle timer overflow) or too complicated, cumbersome to use,
unnecessary object-oriented or otherwise hard to understand and follow.

This Tasker library is intentionally designed to be extremely simple
yet very powerful. It has a short, clean API and clear implementation that fits
on a single page and can be reviewed easily.
Best of all, its API is intentionally similar to JavaScript's timer
functions so HTML/JavaScript programmers will feel at home immediately.
For the unfamiliar with JavaScript there's a short example code included that
illustrates the whole API and its best usage.

How to use
----------

1. place Tasker into your Arduino projects folder so it's in ./libraries/Tasker/Tasker.h
2. in Arduino IDE load File -> Examples -> Tasker -> MultiBlink
3. see how easy it is to add three tasks and run them "at once"
4. use that example as a base for your own code

Tasker API
----------

* <code>Tasker([bool prioritized])</code>. The class constructor takes
  an optional bool flag (that is set to true if omitted). If this flag
  is TRUE then the Tasker prioritizes the scheduled tasks. If the flag
  is FALSE then the Tasker considers all scheduled tasks equal.

* <code>setTimeout(function_name, time_in_milliseconds [, optional_int])</code>
  Will call the <code>function_name</code> in <code>time_in_milliseconds</code> from now.
  Will run it only once. May pass the <code>optional_int</code> parameter into the called function.

* <code>setInterval(function_name, time_in_milliseconds [, optional_int])</code>
  Will call the <code>function_name</code> repeatedly and forever, every
  <code>time_in_milliseconds</code> from now on.
  May pass the <code>optional_int</code> parameter into the called function.

* <code>setRepeated(function_name, time_in_milliseconds, number_of_repeats [, optional_int])</code>
  Will call the <code>function_name</code> repeatedly for <code>number_of_repeats</code>,
  every <code>time_in_milliseconds</code> from now on.
  May pass the <code>optional_int</code> parameter into the called function.

* <code>run()</code> when called it starts the Tasker scheduler and will never return.
  Best to be called as the very last command of the Arduino's <code>setup()</code> function:

```cpp
	void setup() {
		tasker.setInterval(...);
		tasker.run();	// will not return
	}

	void loop() {
		// unused, never called
	}
```

* optional: if you, for whatever reason, don't want to let the <code>Tasker.run()</code>
  govern all of your running code and wish to run Tasker together with some
  existing code you can omit the <code>run()</code> and call the <code>Tasker.loop()</code>
  repeatedly instead.

```cpp
	void setup() {
		tasker.setInterval(...);
	}

	void loop() {
		tasker.loop();	// needs to be called as often as possible
	}
```

Task priorities
---------------
If the Tasker constructor was not called with a FALSE flag then the internal
scheduler will prioritize the tasks in its queue. Tasks added later have lower
priority than those added earlier. Thus you'll want to add your more
important tasks first and the less important ones add afterwards.

```cpp
	Tasker tasker;
	tasker.setInterval(most_important_fn, ..);
	tasker.setInterval(less_important_fn, ..);
	tasker.setInterval(least_important_fn, ..);
```

Normally, when there is enough time for calling each of the scheduled task
at the right time the priorities don't play any role but when a previous task takes
longer time and the scheduler detects that certain tasks are delayed
(are behind their schedule) it needs to decide which task will get run of those
that should have been run already. And that's where the tasks' priorities step
in: the task added earlier (= with a higher priority) will be chosen.
If the priorities were disabled then the scheduler would simply run the next task
in its queue. If all your tasks are equally important you might want to disable
the priorities by passing FALSE into the constructor:

```cpp
	Tasker tasker(false);
	tasker.setInterval(fn, ..);
	tasker.setInterval(equally_important_fn, ..);
	tasker.setInterval(order_doesnt_matter_fn, ..);
```

Caveats
-------
Make sure you define enough task "slots" in the Tasker, before you include its
header file. By default there are 10 slots defined for up to ten tasks running
simultaneously but you might want to increase this number - or even decrease, to
save the precious RAM (each slot takes 14 bytes of RAM).

```cpp
	#define TASKER_MAX_TASKS 32
	#include "Tasker.h"
```

Also, please be aware that the scheduled tasks cannot be stopped. This is
intentional, well-thought-out design decision for this simple Tasker library.
You can always work around this limitation by adding the following condition
as the first instruction in your task function:

```cpp
	void a_task(int) {
		if (should_be_stopped_flag) return;
		...
	}
```

I consider this library finished and stable for everyday use. Adding more features
is not expected, the library will stay short, simple and fast.
